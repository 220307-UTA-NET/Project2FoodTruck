# Project2FoodTruck
Food Truck Web App

This is a full crud app with a frontend in Angular and a backend in C#. It is smaller than the final project two that we submitted as a group. It only accesses one table that is all the Menu Items. This branch is the part of the work that I accomplished to contribute to the final project.

(Original description of Group Project 2)
We are building a website for a food truck. Customers will be able to use the website to look up the food truck menu and where the truck is located. The food truck managers will be able to make changes to their inventory, employee schedules, change menus, and update food truck locations. Employees of the food truck will be able to check their schedule on the website.
